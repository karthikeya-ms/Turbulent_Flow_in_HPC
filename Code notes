1. Figure out how to compute local viscosity
According to reference 4, we have exact solution for local viscosity.

2. Why do we have a 1/Re term inside of total viscosity
It should be the original viscosity, cause velocity and characteristic length are been normlized.

Commute part should be:
1. Function getVis()
2. TurbulentFlowField Stencil

3. Function getHeight()
4. Viscosity Stencil

5. Turbulent parameter keppa = 0.41;
